<p translation-section="home" translation-key="description">
    MHWTools is a collection of utilities made to achieve only one goal: help players making and optimizing armor sets. Are you trying to snitch an extra skill point into your armor set? We got that. You are unsure which weapon/armor set is gonna deal more damage? There's a functionality for that too! If you are looking into pushing your Monster Hunter World experience to the max, then you landed on the right website.

<h3 translation-section="home" translation-key="title_howto">That's cool, how do I use those tools?</h3>
<p translation-section="home" translation-key="description_howto">
    Explaining in just few words how to properly use each and every button is literally impossible but don't worry, in every function there is a FAQ section that will explain you everything you need to know to use those tools like a pro. If you read them already and you feel like something's missing or is not clear enough, please feel free to contact me in order to get further details, this will also help me keeping the FAQ section updated properly.

    <span translation-section="home" translation-key="description_contacts_p1">If you want to contact me send an email to</span> 
    <a href="mailto:mhwtools@outlook.com">mhwtools@outlook.com</a> 
    <span translation-section="home" translation-key="description_contacts_p2">but please be kind, I only speak english and italian so if you write me in any other language you won't get any answer at all.  Also, be patient. I'm not a 24/7 support center so it might take some time before you get an answer, spamming just to draw attention will only put your request at the bottom of the priority queue.</span>
